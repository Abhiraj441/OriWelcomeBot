### 1. Install node.js
### 2. Create a folder & Name it whatever you wish. If you are going to have numerous bots, I recommend you have a Desktop  
### 3. Make sure you have a text editor: Notepad++, Visual Studio, Doesn't matter
### 4. Open up cmd prompt in the file you have just created (I do it by clicking the file name on the top bar where it will say something  like ``C:\Users\epics\Desktop\Bots\*Folder*`` & type ``cmd`` & press enter, here you can install discord.js
### 5. Type ``npm install discord.js``
### 6. Download the index.js & config.json from this Github & place it in the folder where you have just installed Discord.js
### 7. Change the config to suit your server
I have marked down some text to guide you through what to change!
### 8. Save the files & open up the cmd prompt in the same way I told you on step 4 & type: ``node .`` If everything goes to plan it should say that the Welcome Bot is ready & Will tell you how many servers it is added to!
### 9. Share this with your friends who might also benefit from using my bot! :)
