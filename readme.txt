T&C: 

Give credit where it's due; This doesn't mean you have to credit me for making the embeds as its all stuff you can Google, I'm saying don't distribute any of this as your own.
If you are making a video based on this tutorial I want you to link my github somewhere :smile:

If you wish to learn more about Discord.js: https://discord.js.org/#/
If you wish to learn how to make a Discord Bot: https://discordjs.guide/

READ ALL THE STEPS IN MY READ.md on GITHUB!
https://github.com/Oribuin/OriWelcomeBot/blob/master/README.md

Change The fields to whatever you wish it to be in any of the places where it has '', `` or ""
I recommend you don't touch anything else unless you know how to use Discord.js!

JSON Folders don't allow commits so they're in here

DONT USE CONFIG.JSON IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO USE IT AS A WELCOME BOT ONLY

CONFIG.JSON: WHAT TO CHANGE
Change anything that is surrounded by []
Remove the [] Once its changed

INDEX.JS: WHAT TO CHANGE
Change anything surrounded by <> if you want to
Remove the <> once its changed 

IF YOU DO NOT REMOVE THE <> OR [] THE BOT WILL NOT WORK OR WILL JUST HAVE <> AS EVERY MESSAGE IN EMBED
